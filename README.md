# LocalRecon
C# tool to perform local reconnaissance and check for potential privilege escalation vectors.

This tool will perform many of the same checks as [WinPeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng), [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt), and various other Windows recon/priv esc checking tools.  This tool is mainly a way for me to practice performing these activities in C# and potentially have a tool to do so that is more likely to bypass AV detections than the well known tools mentioned before.
